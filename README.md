A reusable core library for shapeshifting metric-collecting agents.

## Overview

This library provides the foundational components needed to build a metric-collecting agent. It was extracted from the Crossbow Metrics project to enable code reuse across different components for various platforms and use-cases.

Key features:

- **Entity Management**: Track entities (interfaces, zones, hosts, etc.)
- **Metric Collection**: Abstract interfaces for metrics collection
- **Metrics Buffering**: Buffer metrics for entities not yet discovered
- **Database Connectivity**: Resilient PostgreSQL connection handling with health monitoring
- **Retry Logic**: Robust retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
- **Configuration Handling**: Flexible configuration loading from various sources

Usage instructions will come after I figure out the interfaces properly myself.
